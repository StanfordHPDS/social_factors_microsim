Without such consideration, we would not know if there were better uses of the resources at hand. The chapter also reaffirms the original Panel’s principle that CEA is not by itself sufficient for decisions as it does not capture all relevant concerns. Most of the ethical issues in the use CEA are distributional issues that involve trade-offs between effects and costs for some patients versus others: How should states of health and disability be evaluated? Should all quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) count equally? Should priority be given to the patients who are the worst off? Does CEA unjustly discriminate against disabled persons? The chapter recommends the use of sensitivity analyses in many cases to illustrate the impact of alternative distributional choices.}",

    abstract = "{As healthcare costs rise in the United States, debate is ongoing over how to obtain better value for dollars spent. In this context, the use of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) is more compelling than ever. This book, written by the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, reviews key concepts and analytic challenges in CEA. The authors endorse the original Panel’s concept of a reference case and support its recommendation that analysts take a broad societal perspective; in addition, they recommend a healthcare sector perspective for a second reference case, as well as an important new framework, the Impact Inventory, for detailing costs and effects. The revisions draw on advances in the field and include three new chapters that capture research on decision modeling, methods for evidence synthesis, and ethical considerations. The volume also includes two new worked examples (Appendix A and Appendix B) to illustrate ways to implement the authors’ recommendations.}",
